# GitHubApi
A reactive microservice built with Quarkus and Java that fetches a GitHub user's repositories (excluding forks) and retrieves detailed branch informationâ€”including branch names and last commit SHAs. The service handles errors gracefully by returning a custom JSON error response when the GitHub user is not found.
